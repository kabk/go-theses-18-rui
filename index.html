		<p class="h1-p">When I first beheld <span class=markdown>![</span><a class="ref-text" id="ref-text-1">these</a><span class=markdown>]</span> cut-out shapes of various models of contemporary mobile devices, I was overwhelmed by emotion. It came from a feeling of immense comfort, in looking at these familiar shapes. I was left with the urge to investigate the relationship between humans and recent technology. This text seeks to investigate this relationship in the process of becoming an individual (having real agency).</p><p class="h1-p">Central questions are (i) in which way conditions form the process of becoming an individual and how those conditions can be changed, (ii) how does our current relationship with technology obstruct the process of becoming an individual (with real agency)? (iii) how can technology be designed so that it facilitates the process of becoming an individual? The preliminary position on these questions are the following. There are necessary conditions for becoming an individual and it is a process which involves both encountering other people and encountering objects. Moreover, this process of becoming is a state of being. Current dominant technologies are designed in such a way that the intent is not congruent with the function. Because experience is highly mediated (both in encountering objects and encountering other people) we are obstructed from acquiring skills and gaining competence. When technology is designed in such a way that it can be not only be repaired and maintained, but also symbiotically developed, then it is a technology through which individuality can be expressed and developed. When the design of technology makes it possible for the intent to be congruent with the function, the results can be contested. Based on judgements of the intention and the function, we can make decisions on how to make adjustments.</p>

		<h2><span class=markdown>##</span> Introduction: Defining Terms</h2>
		
		<div id="ref-div-2" class="ref-item"><ul><a id="ref-item-2" href="https://github.com/kabk" target="_blank">Simondon, Gilbert.</a></ul><ul><a id="ref-item-3" href="https://github.com/kabk"/>Crawford, Matthew. The World Beyond Your Head, Chapter 4: Name of Chapter</a></ul></div>
		
		<p class="h2-p">The use of the term individual in this text is drawn from Simondon’s argument of &quot;individuation&quot; and Matthew Crawford’s argument on necessary conditions for the becoming of the individual. For Simondon <span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" id="ref-text-2" href="https://github.com/kabk">the individual is produced</a><span class=markdown>]</span>, it must coagulate in the course of an ongoing process. Everything begins in the “preindividual” realm which consists of &quot;singularities&quot; that in variable combination can take form. This means there is no preformation, only a variable set of potential. Once preindividual components are in a state of individuation, further individuation can happen to any individual, and it can also happen &quot;transindividually&quot;—on the level of a group. This applies to a wide range of social formations: society consists of many individuations composed of more than one person or entity. Crawford insists that for the individual within these groups to come into being in the first place, the relationship between human to human and human to non-human is <span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" id="ref-text-3" href="https://github.com/kabk">contingent on the form of communication.</a><span class=markdown>]</span> Non-human here refers to our environment—the material, the technical, the mediated.</p>

		<div id="ref-div-3" class="ref-item"><ul><a id="ref-item-4" href="https://github.com/kabk"/>Crawford, Matthew. The World Beyond Your Head, Chapter 4: Name of Chapter</a></ul></div>

		<p class="h2-p">By coupling the living individual with its (nishe) environment, we can understand what is unique and enclosed about the individual precisely in terms of its relation to the environment from which it requires contact and sustenance. As elaborated by Crawford, if technologies serve to sever this contact, individuation cannot be engendered. Just as Simondon shows the <span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" id="ref-text-4" href="texts/simondon">process of individuation to take place in between “form” and “matter”</a><span class=markdown>]</span>—rather than being the imposition of an existing form upon a previously shapeless matter—so information cannot just be abstractly opposed to the medium in which it is instantiated, or across which it is transmitted. Medium and message intersect. The emphasis is on the continual change or becoming, not its constancy but it is continuing ability to grow by altering itself. The possibility of alteration is thus a necessary condition.</p>

            <div id="chapter3"></div>

		<h2><span class=markdown>##</span> Chapter 1: What is the Individual and How is it Formed?</h2>

		<p class="h2-p">When the humanity of an other becomes apparent, it is because you have noticed something particular in that person. This particularity can not be seen without discrimination. As for the person having this particularity, this comes from developing individuality and thus wants to be recognized as such. This development comes from cultivating some particular excellence or skill. This developmental process is a state of being, and is contingent on how we encounter other people and how we encounter objects. For Hegel, as elaborated by Crawford, one knows oneself by one’s deeds, which are inherently social.The meaning of an action depends on how others receive them. This implies that individuality too, is something that we achieve only in and through our dealings with others. The question is, how can you make yourself intelligible to others through your actions, and receive back a reflected view of yourself. When we act in the world we make a tacit normative claim for ourselves—for the justifiability of the act. The question of justification only arises if you are challenged by another—the person rejects the validity of your claim to be acting with justification. Confrontation leads you to evaluate your actions. This is necessary if you are to own your actions and identify with them as your own.</p>


		<div id="ref-div-4" class="ref-item"><ul><a id="ref-item-5" href="https://github.com/kabk"/>something</a></ul></div>

		<p class="h2-p">We are embodied beings who use tools and prosthetics in the world. It is a world we act in, not merely observe. This means that when you acquire new skills, you come to see the world differently, and see possibilities not previously visible to you. Real agency arises not merely in the context of choices freely made but rather in the context in submission to things that have their own intractable ways. Technical activity is a way we go about this; <span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" id="ref-text-5" href="texts/simondon">the capacity to perceive and invent new relationships among heterogeneous things, to produce forms</a><span class=markdown>]</span>. Becoming an individual is thus strongly linked to the acquisition of skills and gaining competence, and it is through and with technology that we do so. If we act through and with technology, then it is impending to ask how it shapes our sense of agency. Agency is the question of who or what is acting, and what is the intention of the action. If we don’t know who or what is acting, then how can we hold the action up for contestation? when acting with and through technology, how can we have control of the action, or in other words, how can we know that the intent is congruent with the function. If individual agency is contingent on a reciprocal and collaborative relation between humans and between humans and non-human, then it follows that the possibility of this relation relies on technical knowledge and understanding. That is not to say however that it requires us all to become engineers or hackers, but rather it is through technology’s design that we can foster a reciprocal relation. However, dominant design of technology seems to manifest an epidemical obscurantism. It can be seen in the general societal rejection of technical understanding as it manifests in the advent of sleek, shiny, corporate-controlled objects, platforms and services, from the smartphone to self-driven vehicles. Our interaction with these devices form experiences that are highly mediated (both in encountering objects and encountering other people). In turn, individual agency, the experience of seeing direct effect of your actions in the world and knowing that these actions are genuinely your own, and acquiring skills and gaining competence, may become not only elusive but illusory.</p>

		<p class="h2-p">Let’s consider the design of the smartphone, and the products and services it contains. Products and services come in the form of applications. You interact with the device and software applications through predefined motions on its sleek surface, known as touchscreen gestures. These gestures are performed with ease and the applications are most often simple, and easy enough on the mind to use. Why are they designed this way, and what kind of relationship does it form between human to human and human to non-human? the most common uses of the smartphone are making calls, taking pictures, instant messaging, social media, watching videos, and gaming. There are numerous apps for each of these categories. What is the intention that guides the design and dissemination of the smartphone and the major social media platforms—YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest? these products and services rely on advertising revenue, the more frequently we use them, the more money they make. It follows that the aim of their design is to harvest attention. They do this by manufacturing habits, and there is a formula for how to do that. Nir Eyal, a business entrepreneur, has laid out a business model for how to build habit-forming technology. He calls it <span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" id="ref-text-6" href="dsdfd">The Hook Model</a><span class=markdown>]</span>: a four-step process companies use to form habits. The four steps are: trigger, action, reward, and investment. These are all based on the psychology of human behavior which I will now further explain.</p>

		<p class="h2-p">An external trigger is something that prompts a user to action. This sensory stimuli is delivered through any number of things in our environment. Digital examples are the play button, e-mail icon, an app icon, or the log in and sign up buttons. Then, internal triggers are built, which involves making mental or emotional associations with the product. So for instance, feelings of boredom, loneliness, frustration, confusion, and indecisiveness often instigate a mental itch and prompts an action to remedy the negative sensation. A habit-forming technology seeks to solve the users’ itch by creating an association so that the user identifies the technology as the source of relief.</p>

		<p class="h2-p">How does instagram apply this? The app icon and the push notifications serve as external triggers to get users to return to the product. The fear of losing a moment instigates stress, and this negative emotion is the internal trigger that brings users back to the app to ameliorate this itch by capturing a photo. Sharing and affirmation via the like button, relieves the feeling of boredom or loneliness.</p>

		<p class="h2-p">A trigger is followed by the action: the behavior done in anticipation for the reward. Based on research and studies by psychologist J. B. Fogg, Eyal explains that the less effort it takes, both physically and mentally, to perform the action, the more likely humans are to perform it. Herein lies the reasons behind the ease of the tap gesture and the simplicity of social media homepages. (insert homepage screenshot?)</p>

		<p class="h2-p">After the action, is the reward. Eyal explains that in an experiment conducted in the 1950s by psychologist BF Skinner, it was revealed that humans seek rewards in three forms: social rewards (we seek to feel accepted, attractive, important and included), rewards of resources and information, and intrinsic rewards of mastery, competence and completion. The &quot;feed&quot; on many online products for instance, is algorithmically designed to take advantage of rewards associated with the pursuit of resources and information. The stream of limitless information is filled with both dull and interesting content. So when you log in to a platform, one of ten items may interesting, or one of a hundred, and this is the reward. To gain more rewards all you have to do is keep scrolling. Checking your notifications and feeling the need to click on each of them is an example of how the search for mastery, completion, and competence moves users to habitual and often mindless actions. The number of unmarked notifications represents a goal to be completed.</p>

		<p class="h2-p">In an <span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" id="ref-text-7" href="dsdfd">experiment conducted by Stanford researchers</a><span class=markdown>]</span>, it was shown that reciprocation is not just a characteristic expressed between people, but also a trait observed when humans interact with machines. We invest in products and services for the same reasons we put effort into our relationships. In congruence, the last step of the Hook Model is investment. Investments enable the accrual of stored value in the form of content, data, followers, reputation, or skill. The more users invest time and effort into a product or service, the more they value it. Storing value in the form of content for instance, would be the followers, playlists, likes, and comments. In aggregate, it becomes more valuable over time and thus the service and product tied to it becomes more difficult to leave as the personal investment grows. Another form of investment is skill. Investing time and effort into learning to use a product is a form of investment and stored value. Simply, once users have invested the effort to acquire a skill, they are less likely to switch to a competing product.</p>

		<p class="h2-p">The major social media platforms are examples of where design choices are made according to The Hook Model. Pinterest in particular is an encompassing example of this. The internal trigger for users of Pinterest is often boredom. Once you have registered the only action required is to scroll, and in return you are provided with rewards. It displays rewards surrounding the hunt for objects of desire—images. The rewards of the tribe come from the variability of posting images as a communication medium. And users invest in the site every time they pin, re-pin, like, or comment on an image. Through the notifications of when someone else contributes to the thread, the user is triggered to visit the site again. A constant loop.</p>

		<p class="h2-p">Psychological irritation is something that compels us to action. It is, as shown, part of our brains operating system. What are the consequences of relieving these itches through the aforementioned technologies? If we seek skill and competence and pursue this through and with technologies that are designed to relive us of these mental itches, what are the skills and competences acquired? is the act of caressing your touchscreen a valuable skill? and is the information in your feed—the two-second visual puns, click-bait headliners, and the like—valuable information? And what if these habits take up more of our time than concentrating on more difficult and demanding tasks required for education?</p>

<!-- div7 -->

		<p class="h2-p">We endlessly hear about how fragmented our mental lives have become—diminished attention spans and a widespread sense of distraction. This is often related to some new neuroscience finding on how our brains are being rewired by our habits of information gazing and electronic stimulation. Our mental lives have definitely become more fragmented, and the question is how to maintain a self that is able to act according to settled purposes and ongoing projects, rather than distractingly float about. There is a sense of criticality here, especially considering how much time we spend using <span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" id="ref-text-8" href="dsdfd">habit-forming technologies.</a><span class=markdown>]</span></p>

		<p class="h2-p">The attractions of our attentional environment that we willingly invite into our lives (our feeds) and the unwanted intrusions (advertising) are both troubling in form. They are both cases of the advent of hyper-palatable mental stimuli. If this is the dominating form of stimuli, it leaves little time for higher order thinking that is required in education. The content of your education forms you, but it requires powers of concentration and a focus without distraction on cognitively demanding tasks that are not immediately gratifying. This is a threat if your mental capacities are exhausted by distraction. To insist on the importance of trained powers of concentration is to recognize that independence of thought and feeling requires certain conditions. In our frenetic technology age, our distractibility seems to indicate that we are agnostic on the question of what is worth paying attention to—that is, what to value. What is at stake of human flourishing when our need of acquiring skill and competence is psychologically remedied by means of manipulation? this fetish of automaticity and disconnection is not a tendency of technology, if we insist that the proper standards of technology are simply those of function. Rather, it is the tendency of a peculiar consumer ethic. Disconnection—tapping or swiping to make something happen—facilitates an experience of ones own will as something unconditioned by all those contingencies that intervene between an intention and its realization.</p>

They get into a state of total absorption where all else falls away, and this is only possible because the messy human realities behind the financial entities they are trading in (for example peoples mortgages) are mediated away by layers of representation and mathematical models, allowing a kind of control without contact. Needless to say in these years leading up to the financial crisis this quasi-autistic financial game caused massive casualties but they took place somewhere else, out in the world beyond the screen.&quot;</a><span class=markdown>]</span></p>

		<h2><span class=markdown>##</span> Chapter 4: Design Methodologies</h2>

		<p class="h2-p">We must derive and question the intention that guides technology’s design and its dissemination into every area of life. It is our networks of information from which potential is derived, and enables us to utilize what already exists to construct the new. And it is with designs of technology that are open-source, hackable, shareable, comprehensible, that we can do so. Returning to the art piece by Antonia Hirsch mentioned in the first sentence of this text, taking touchscreen devices out of the usual context, led me to reflect on the emotion it evoked in me, and begin investigating what kind of relationship we have with technology and why. This is exemplifies what effect art can have on us and what role it has for us. My preliminary position was that the process of becoming an individual is a continual process and is dependent on acquiring skills and gaining competence. The way in which we do that is through and with technology. And so it follows that in order to gain competence and skill, the relation between the human and the technology needs to be a collaborative and reciprocal one. For the last entry of this text I will elaborate on design methodologies which in combination are valuable efforts in establishing this relation, and undermining the dominant design of technology that places the designer/creator at one end, and the user/consumer at the other. The three design methodologies are speculative art and design, hack design, and open design.</p>
		
		<h3><span class=markdown>###</span> Speculative Art and Design</h3>

		<p class="h3-p">By placing new technological developments within imaginary but believable everyday situations, speculative art and design projects allow us to debate the implications of different technological futures before they happen. It creates a space for criticality, through which our assumptions and conceptions about the role objects and systems have in our lives are challenged. Speculating about the future allows us to imagine problems that might still be beneath the surface, or factors that are unknown, yet plausible or possible. </p>

		<p class="h3-p">There are four types of potential futures which are taken from Joseph Voros’s &quot;A Primer on Futures Studies, Foresight and the Use of Scenarios&quot;. Joseph Voros, a theoretical physics who has worked on mathematical extensions to the General Theory of Relativity, and later worked several years in Internet-related companies, and now works as a futurist and strategic foresight analyst. The types of futures are:</p>

		<p class="h3-p">Possible futures: futures that &quot;might happen&quot; and involve scientific knowledge that does not exist yet.</p>

		<p class="h3-p">Probable futures: futures that are &quot;likely to happen,&quot; extrapolating from current trends. Usually involves simple linear extension of the present.</p>

		<p class="h3-p">Plausible futures: futures which &quot;could happen&quot; according to our current knowledge of how things work—our understanding of physical laws, processes, causation, systems of human interaction.</p>

		<p class="h3-p">Preferable futures: the three types of futures described above are all largely concerned with informational or cognitive knowledge. Preferable futures are concerned with what we &quot;want to&quot; happen; in other words, these futures are largely emotional rather than cognitive. They derive from value judgements, and are more overtly subjective than the previous three types. Moreover, preferable futures can lie in any of the other three types.</p>

		<p class="h2-p">Speculative design ideas, ideals, and approaches, take form in fields of design, architecture, cinema, photography and fine art, spanning from political theory, the philosophy of technology, literary fiction and surely more. I will be focusing on Bruce sterlings’ design concept of Spimes which speculate and reflect upon the future of more preferable and sustainable technological products, and secondly on Kim Laughton&#39;s’ digital rendering artwork which often depicts a merging of consumer products, technological fetishism, image production and labor.</p>

		<p class="h2-p">In “Shaping Things” Bruce Sterling’s lays out the concept of&nbsp;Spimes,&nbsp;which speculates on a future of more preferable and sustainable technological products. In short, a Spime is a location-aware, environment-aware, self-logging, self-documenting, uniquely identified object that transmits data about itself and its environment to a system. Here is a brief summary of what constitutes a Spime and how this system would work. You would first encounter the Spime as a virtual image while searching on a website. This image would be linked with three-dimensional computer-designed engineering specifications of the object. It would include material specifications, engineering tolerances, and so on. This object would not exist until you legally guarantee that you want it—by purchasing it. Your account information would be embedded in that transaction and it would be integrated into your Spime management inventory system. Upon delivery you have the object’s unique ID code, consisting of information about its material, ownership history, geographical tracking to establish its position in space and time, and other information that could contribute to any modification of the object. At the end of its lifespan, it is deactivated, disassembled, and put back into the manufacturing stream. And its data will remain available for historical analysis.</p>

		<p class="h3-p">Sterling speculative system is a source for thinking of how sustainable and manufactured object might look like and how it could work in a system, as opposed to the disposable products that currently permeate our society. Since sterling published the concept, there have been several <span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" id="ref-text-10" href="dsdfd">attempts at making such objects and systems</a><span class=markdown>]</span>. It has also resulted in reflections on the possible downsides of location-aware, self-identifying, always-on devices (the fact that the objects are always trackable in space and time). Ultimately the downsides are that of privacy concerns—<span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" id="ref-text-11" href="dsdfd">&quot;there a lot of socio-political functional personal reasons to be suspicious of how tracking might be (mis)used both by individual and by governments. It is already a rapidly advancing technology with dark sides. From a company providing technology to spy on ones employees or ones spouse and children, to governments or corporations surveilling your online activity and possibly prosecuting you based on the data.&quot;</a><span class=markdown>]</span></p>

		<p class="h3-p">In his digital rendering artwork, Kim Laughton encourages a discussion about the power of technologies and images. <span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" id="ref-text-12" href="https://vimeo.com/242286953">His CGI videos are often reflective on the creation of images using CGI software</a><span class=markdown>]</span>, that is to say, the <span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" id="ref-text-13" href="https://vimeo.com/223161717">videos are self-reflective</a><span class=markdown>]</span>.

		<h3><span class=markdown>###</span> Hack Design</h3>

		<figcaption id="ref-list-18">links to article</figcaption>


		<p class="h3-p">Hack design serves to undermine and dismantle current designs of technology. &quot;<span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" href="ref-list-18">&quot;Hacking is about overcoming the limitations of an existing object, service or system which was set for one purpose, and finding an access point, intellectually or physically, where its original function can be expanded, altered, or improved to serve a new purpose or solve a problem.&quot;</a><span class=markdown>[</span> It is the will to re-purpose existing designs of systems or objects in ways more precisely tailored to how you want to use it. It merges rather than separates design and people, and yields benefits in the process. This merging fosters a different type of engagement between the product and the user, and a reciprocity between the user and the designer. As stressed throughout this text, the dominant model for design has placed the designer/creator at one end, and the consumer at the other. Hack design serves as a process that facilitates the ingenuity to expand the potential of what has been created. By enabling the end user to be part of the process and not only on the receiving end of it. This approach does not necessarily result in designs in the sense of disciplined design. Often it gives the impression that the object or system is unfinished—something that is in process. It may therefore be unstable as it is presented, but this entails that it pertains the potential role of being didactic, that is to say it requires and fosters education. Hack design is an approach that enables alterations that are inevitably variable in outcome. It also bears the possibility of improving the skill and competence of whomever should encounter the object or system.</p>

		<figcaption id="ref-list-19">"https://github.com/84003/facepace"</figcaption>


		<p class="h3-p">In early 2017, I set out to reveal the intent of a habit-forming technology—the Facebook feed. It was based on a common experience: logging in to Facebook to quickly check something, only to find yourself mindlessly scrolling an hour later. The aim was to make the user not only aware of the mindless activity is due to its design, but also to prevent the habit. Together with Kees van Drongelen, I developed a <span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" href="ref-list-19">browser extension</a><span class=markdown>]</span> which makes your Facebook feed disappear, only upon scrolling hastily and constantly does the feed appear. Once you stop scrolling the feed disappears again. The distribution of this small browser hack, could be considered a possible solution to elucidate the intentions of technology’s design that do not have your best interest in mind. If hack designs can provide a space for criticality and raise awareness, then you may come to ask if the technology is serving you, or if you are serving the technology. The next design methodology to be discussed is one which results in objects and systems that invites hacking.</p>

		<h3><span class=markdown>###</span> Open Design</h3>

		<figcaption id="ref-list-20">http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=499</figcaption>
		<figcaption id="ref-list-21">http://opendesign.foundation/</figcaption>


		<p class="h3-p">Design which attempt to foster a reciprocal relation between technology and human. Qualifications of open design are open-source, hackable, comprehensible, alterable, constructible. I will be elaborating on these qualifications in terms of software development, but note that open design is not limited to immaterial production, as the same method of production that has come to dominate the world of open source software and freely available (often user-generated) content on the internet, <span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" href="ref-list-20">also extends to designing and making material things.</a><span class=markdown>[</span> Essentially <span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" href="ref-list-21">open design</a></a><span class=markdown>]</span> is about the concept of sharing. This means the user can take what is given, make alterations according to their needs, transform it and redistribute it to others. The implications of open source, a material ontology of sharing practices, therefore strongly bears a social dimension.</p>

		<figcaption id="ref-list-22">is a author of blabla</figcaption>
		<figcaption id="ref-list-23">link to quote</figcaption>


		<p class="h3-p">Sharing (open-source) code is a relatively recent form of cultural sharing. Sharing is part of how a community operates within any field that creates media. <span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" href="ref-list-22">Steve lambert</a><span class=markdown>[</span>, explains how we are familiar with <span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" href="ref-list-23">“the image of scientists working in labs, researching, generating and testing hypotheses, then publishing their work in journals or otherwise presenting their work to the scientific community. As an analogy, this method of researching and publishing extends to writers, performers, musicians, software developers, and anyone else who creates media. Extending this analogy, repeating the research someone else has done is redundant. The goal of publishing research outcomes is to make progress. This can only happen if the work is documented so that theories, techniques, and knowledge can be built upon. Through this process, scientific theories are established, art movements emerge, musical styles develop into new styles, software becomes more sophisticated. Knowledge is collected and developed, and progress is made over generations. This is why we share our research.&quot;</a><span class=markdown>[</span> For software, open design means that the result is not a product, but a project. I will elaborate on what is meant by this, but in order to talk about what qualifies software as open design, I must first mention The Free Software Movement.</p>

		<figcaption id="ref-list-24">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html</figcaption>


		<p class="h3-p"><span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" href="ref-list-23">The Free Software Movement</a><span class=markdown>[</span> emerged in the early 1980s in response to efforts to withhold software program source code to increase profit, such as non-disclosure agreements and the patenting of software concepts. Richard Stallman the founder of free software movement, created Four Freedoms of what constitutes a free software: </p>

		<p class="h3-p"><span class=markdown>></span> Freedom 0: You are free to run the program, for any purpose.</p>

		<p class="h3-p"><span class=markdown>></span> Freedom 1: You are free to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</p>

		<p class="h3-p"><span class=markdown>></span> Freedom 2: You are free to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.</p>

		<p class="h3-p"><span class=markdown>></span> Freedom 3: You are free to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public so that the whole community benefits.</p>

		<figcaption id="ref-list-25">networks book</figcaption>

		<p class="h3-p">Well-known examples of open-source programs include the Linux operating system, the Apache Web Server, Mozilla Firefox web browser, and the web publishing software WordPress. In a case study in web art and design, Steve lambert <span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" href="ref-list-25">held up Adobe Photoshop against these four freedoms</a><span class=markdown>[</span> to examine the implications of not meeting the qualifications:</p>

		<p class="h3-p"><span class=markdown>></span> Freedom 0: Are we free to use Photoshop for any purpose? Sure, we can use Photoshop to make everything from a corporate presentation to pornography.</p>
		
		<p class="h3-p"><span class=markdown>></span> Freedom 1: Are we free to study the program and adapt it to our needs? In one way, yes, we can get an Adobe Photoshop manual and learn how the program works, and we can customize the workspace and write Photoshop Actions to script the program and adapt it to our needs. But, these are relatively insignificant changes. The source code is not publicly available and we cannot adapt the software by changing the source code, so thereby Photoshop fails to meet this freedom.</p>
			
		<p class="h3-p"><span class=markdown>></span> Freedom 2: Can we redistribute copies of Photoshop to help our neighbors? While that may be how some people obtain copies of the program, technically this is a violation of the user license, and therefore illegal. The third freedom is violated.</p>
			
		<p class="h3-p"><span class=markdown>></span> Freedom 3: Can I make improvements to Photoshop and release, or even sell, the Photoshop “Steve Lambert Edition” for the benefit of Photoshop users? No, absolutely not. This freedom is also violated.</p>

		<figcaption id="ref-list-26">networks book</figcaption>

		<p class="h3-p">Adobe’s model is on selling licenses of their software. Each license (copy of the software) has to be bought. For innovation, one could argue that Adobe creates quality products and it certainly is an industry leader. But we are not free to improve their work, we are not free to examine it, and we are not free to distribute it. What if Adobe were to stop supporting or releasing one of the programs they currently distribute? Their code remains inaccessible. As explained by Steve lambert, in the case of <span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" href="ref-list-26">WordPress, this project would never have come about if the abandoned project b2cafelog, from which WordPress was developed, had it been licensed with a proprietary license.</a><span class=markdown>[</span></p>

		<img id="ref-list-30" src="images/facebook-warning.jpp">

		<p class="h3-p">Let&#39;s turn to the open design software Mozilla Firefox web browser. You do not have to purchase it, you are free to build on it by contributing core code or through extensions and add-ons, or creating Firefox software offshoots like CELTX. <span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" href="ref-list-27">Add-ons</a><span class=markdown>]</span> are sub-programs that extend the browsers functionality. Mozilla Firefox is a project, not a product. You can alter it by adding existing plug-ins which are themselves projects, you can build a plug-in (in collaboration with others), or you can make a larger alterations by working on the source-code. And going from user, to designer, to programmer, requires increase in skill, but is not inaccessible. And the user is not merely a consumer, making alterations does not require high level skill. Moreover, on the Mozilla blog there are posts documenting <span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" href="ref-list-28">ways to hack Mozilla Firefox.</a><span class=markdown>[</span> These hacks include plug-ins and add-ons, new developer editions, etc. Moreover, their <span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" href="ref-list-29">source code is available on the software development platform GitHub</a>,<span class=markdown>]</span> where anyone can file issues or design requests. Notice though, in the example I gave of the project that involved hacking facebook through a browser extension, when tempering with the existing CSS using the Page Inspector tool, not only did Facebook developers try to hinder tempering by restricting the code, but also prompted <span class=markdown>[</span><a class="ref-text" href="ref-list-30">a warning message</a><span class=markdown>]</span> from which you are implicitly made to feel you are doing something malicious or suspicious. That is because Facebook is a product, not a project. But if it were, then it likely not resemble its current state. It would take on a different form and in turn we could perhaps begin to change the presuppositions of Facebook which defines identity, the individual and how it is expressed, social relations, and so on.</p>
		

		<h2><span class=markdown>##</span> Part 5: Conclusion</h2>
