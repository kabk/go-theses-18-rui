		<p class="text"> When I first beheld <span class="pop-up">these<span><img src="a-hirsch1.jpg"/><br/></span></span> cut-out shapes of various models of contemporary mobile devices, I was overwhelmed by emotion. It came from a feeling of immense comfort, in looking at these familiar shapes. I was left with the urge to investigate the relationship between humans and recent technology. Moreover, how this relationship is linked to individuation.</p>
		<p class="text"> This text seeks to examine the following:</p>
		<p class= "questions" > In which way conditions form the process of becoming an individual, and how those conditions can be changed.</p>
	   	<p class= "questions" > How our current relationship with technology obstruct the process of becoming an individual with real agency. Real agency here means, the experience of seeing direct effect of your actions in the world and knowing that these actions are genuinely your own.</p>
	  	<p class= "questions" > How can technology be designed so that it facilitates the process of becoming an individual?</p>
		<p class="text"> The preliminary position: the process of becoming an individual is a state of being. There are necessary conditions for becoming an individual, and it involves both encountering objects and encountering other people.</p>

		<p class="text"> Becoming an individual is not exclusive to technology. It is a process which happens with and through technology. It forms you whether you are aware of how or not, whether you have technological knowledge or not. But with less awareness, much like the factory worker, you become a tool of technology rather than forming a reciprocal and collaborative relation.</p>
