		<p class="subtitle">Technology is being done by you</p>
		<p class="text"> When I first beheld <a class="popup" href="a-hirsch1.jpg">these</a> cut-out shapes of various models of contemporary mobile devices, I was overwhelmed by emotion. It came from a feeling of immense comfort, in looking at these familiar shapes. I was left with the urge to investigate the relationship between humans and recent technology. More specifically, the subject I am researching is the relationship between humans and recent technology in the process of becoming an individual with real agency. Individual agency here means, the experience of seeing direct effect of your actions in the world and knowing that these actions are genuinely your own.</p>
		<p class="text"> This text seeks to answer the following:</p>
		<p class= "questions" > In which way conditions form the process of becoming an individual and how those conditions can be changed.</p>
	   	<p class= "questions" > How does our current relationship with technology obstruct the process of becoming an individual with real agency?</p>
	  	<p class= "questions" > How can technology be designed so that it facilitates the process of becoming an individual?</p>
		<p class="text"> The preliminary position: the process of becoming an individual is a state of being. moreover, there are necessary conditions for becoming an individual and it involves both encountering objects and encountering other people.</p>

		<p class="text"> Becoming an individual is not exclusive to technology. It is a process which happens with and through technology. It forms you whether you are aware of how or not, whether you have technological knowledge or not. but with less awareness, much like the factory worker, you become a tool of technology rather than forming a reciprocal and collaborative relation.</p>
