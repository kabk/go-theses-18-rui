		<p class="subtitle">Technology is being done by you</p>
		<p class="text"> The subject I am researching is the relationship between humans and recent technology in the process of becoming an individual with real agency. Individual agency here means, the experience of seeing direct effect of your actions in the world and knowing that these actions are genuinely your own.</p>
		<p class="text"> This text seeks to answer the following:</p>
		<p class= "questions" > In which way conditions form the process of becoming an individual and how those conditions can be changed.</p>
	   	<p class= "questions" > How does our current relationship with technology obstruct the process of becoming an individual with real agency?</p>
	  	<p class= "questions" > How can technology be designed so that it facilitates the process of becoming an individual?
		</p>
		<p class="text"> The preliminary position: the process of becoming an individual is a state of being. moreover, there are necessary conditions for becoming an individual and it involves both encountering objects and encountering other people.
