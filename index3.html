		<p class="main-text"> When I first beheld <span class="pop-up">these<span><img src="a-hirsch1.jpg"/><br/></span></span> cut-out shapes of various models of contemporary mobile devices, I was overwhelmed by emotion. It came from a feeling of immense comfort, in looking at these familiar shapes. I was left with the urge to investigate the relationship between humans and recent technology. This text seeks to investigate this relationship in the process of becoming an individual (having real agency). central questions are (1) in which way conditions form the process of becoming an individual and how those conditions can be changed, (2) how does our current relationship with technology obstruct the process of becoming an individual (with real agency)? (3) how can technology be designed so that it facilitates the process of becoming an individual? The preliminary position on these questions are the following. there are necessary conditions for becoming an individual and it is a process which involves both encountering other people and encountering objects. moreover, this process of becoming is a state of being. current dominant technologies are designed in such a way that the intent is not congruent with the function. because experience is highly mediated (both in encountering objects and encountering other people) we are obstructed from acquiring skills and gaining competence. when technology is designed in such a way that it can be not only be repaired and maintained, but also symbiotically developed, then it is a technology through which individuality can be expressed and developed. when the design of technology makes it possible for the intent to be congruent with the function, the results can be contested. based on judgements of the intention and the function, we can make decisions on how to make adjustments.</p>
		
		<p class="subtitle">Introduction: Defining Terms</p>

		<p class="main-text">The use of the term individual in this text is drawn from Simondon’s argument of "individuation" and Matthew Crawford’s argument on necessary conditions for the becoming of the individual. For Simondon the individual is produced, it must coagulate in the course of an ongoing process. Everything begins in the “preindividual” realm which consists of "singularities" that in variable combination can take form. This means there is no preformation, only a variable set of potential. Once preindividual components are in a state of individuation, further individuation can happen to any individual, and it can also happen "transindividually"—on the level of a group. This applies to a wide range of social formations: society consists of many individuations composed of more than one person or entity. Crawford insists that for the individual within these groups to come into being in the first place, the relationship between human to human and human to non-human is contingent on the form of communication. Non-human here refers to our environment—the material, the technical, the mediated.</p>
	
		<p class="main-text">By coupling the living individual with its (niche) environment, we can understand what is unique and enclosed about the individual precisely in terms of its relation to the environment from which it requires contact and sustenance. as elaborated by Crawford, if technologies serve to sever this contact, individuation cannot be engendered. just as Simondon shows the process of individuation to take place in between “form” and “matter”—rather than being the imposition of an existing form upon a previously shapeless matter—so information cannot just be abstractly opposed to the medium in which it is instantiated, or across which it is transmitted. medium and message intersect. the emphasis is on the continual change or becoming, not its constancy but it is continuing ability to grow by altering itself. the possibility of alteration is thus a necessary condition.  </p>

		<p class= "subtitle" >Chapter 1: What is the Individual and How is it Formed?</p>
	   	<p class= "main-text" >When the humanity of an other becomes apparent, it is because you have noticed something particular in that person. this particularity can not be seen without discrimination. as for the person having this particularity, this comes from developing individuality and thus wants to be recognized as such. this development comes from cultivating some particular excellence or skill. this developmental process is a state of being, and is contingent on how we encounter other people and how we encounter objects. for Hegel, one knows oneself by one’s deeds, which are inherently social. the meaning of an action depends on how others receive them. this implies that individuality too, is something that we achieve only in and through our dealings with others. the question is, how can you make yourself intelligible to others through your actions, and receive back a reflected view of yourself. when we act in the world we make a tacit normative claim for ourselves—for the justifiability of the act. the question of justification only arises if you are challenged by another—the person rejects the validity of your claim to be acting with justification. confrontation leads you to evaluate your actions. this is necessary if you are to own your actions and identify with them as your own.</p>
